It may be hard to imagine a time when Singapore was not the bustling modern city
of today. However, when Sir Raffles arrived in the early 1800s, there were less 
than 1,000 people living on the island. 

Merchants set up base in the growing city, and over the coming centuries the 
area gradually developed from its fishing roots into a major port of trade.
 
It wasn’t easy to control the rise in migration, in the 1850s, the city had 
only 12 police officers trying to keep the peace amongst 60,000 citizens!





During the Dutch Golden Age, construction started on the intricate web of 
canals that today define Amsterdam. Over 100 kilometres of waterways now 
divide 1,500 historic buildings across the city’s 90 islands.

Between the two main outer canals, Westerkerk, one of the nation’s first 
Protestant churches, was built. Its tower is still the highest in the city. 

According to her diary, its chiming bells brought solace to Anne Frank, who 
would watch the minutes tick by on the clocktower visible from her window.
