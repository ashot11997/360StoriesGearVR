In front of you, you will see the Powder Tower, built 600 years ago, it has stood watching the rise and fall of empires, and the rule of many Czech kings of Bohemia.

In 1945, the citizens of Prague flooded these streets to celebrate the official end of WWII, as the liberating tanks of the Soviet army rolled through the gates of this tower.

Even though the third reich hand capitulated one day earlier, and the Prague Uprising rid the streets of Nazis, the crowds were elated at the sight of an allied army after five years of occupation.

Feel the events of the city come alive around this Old Town gate.
